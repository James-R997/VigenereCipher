appearantly vigenere cipheres are just caesar but different for each possition in the of the key, which makes sense, cuz each planetext is shifted by the exact letter in the key in a specific possition, that means if we devided the cipher into N amount of subtexts (where N is the length of the key word (not repeated)) we should get multiple caesar ciphers, using FA we can know the shift that way, which reveals a letter from the key, this seems promissing, im gonna try it, first im gonna log in to get the found1 and found2 messages from the server to get them properly and then im gonna itterate through them in python and devide them into 6 subtext
